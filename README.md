# IOT-based-Water-Level-Monitor

## Introduction

Water is essential for life, but it is also a precious resource that must be managed carefully. IoT based water level monitoring systems can help to ensure that water is used efficiently and effectively.

These systems use sensors to measure the water level in real time. The data from the sensors is then sent to a cloud-based platform, where it can be analyzed and visualized. This information can be used to make decisions about water management, such as when to irrigate crops or when to release water from a reservoir.

IoT based water level monitoring systems offer a number of benefits, including:

Real-time data: The data from the sensors is available in real time, so you can make decisions about water management quickly and efficiently.
Remote monitoring: The system can be monitored remotely, so you don't have to be on-site to check the water level.
Cost-effectiveness: IoT based water level monitoring systems are relatively inexpensive to install and maintain.

The monitored data is transferred using MQTT Protocol. The raspberry pi has also been interfaced with a LCD display to provide the monitored real time data to the user.
